We got an error:

```sh
steps/make_mfcc_pitch.sh: line 157: run.pl: command not found
```

This is because `run.pl` is not in the present directory or `$PATH`.
We solved this by replace it with `utils/parallel/run.pl` in `cmd.sh`.

`local/aishell_prepare_dict.sh` extracts the non-silence phones from
`lexicon.txt`, grouped by the same phones with different indexes.
It also prepares the (optional) silence phones and the extra questions that are
simply all the phones.
<!-- TODO: What is this extra questions? -->
